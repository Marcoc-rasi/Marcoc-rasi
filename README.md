## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### üì± iOS & Swift Expertise

- **Swift Mastery:** Operators, optionals, generics, enums, control flow, and type safety  
- **Architecture Patterns:** MVC, MVVM, MVC-C, modularization with clean separation of concerns  
- **Robust Code:** Guard statements, type casting, extensions, protocols for safer logic  
- **UI Development:**
  - `SwiftUI:` Modular UIs with `VStack`, `ZStack`, `NavigationStack`, animations, and `TabView` flows  
  - `UIKit:` Expert use of `UIViewController`, `Segue`, `NavigationController`, `ScrollView`, `TableView`, and advanced `Compositional Layout` with `UICollectionView`  
  - Auto Layout, stack views, and complete understanding of the View Controller Lifecycle

### üåê Networking & Data Management

- **Data Persistence:** `UserDefaults`, `FileManager`, `Core Data` for complex structured storage  
- **Networking:** `URLSession` with JSON decoding, error handling, and request retries  
- **Concurrency:** Use of `async/await` for responsive UIs  
- **Data Handling:** Closures, Combine patterns, decoupled and testable logic with `@escaping` and encapsulated updates

### üß™ Testing & Debugging

- **XCTest:** Unit & integration tests for components and data flows  
- **XCUI Tests:** Simulation of real-world workflows in iOS Simulator & real devices  
- **Snapshot Testing:** For visual consistency across devices and OS versions  
- **Debugging:** Breakpoints, logs, Instruments, Connections Inspector, and memory profiling
